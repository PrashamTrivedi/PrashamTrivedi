A developer with proven experience on Android and keen interest in Node JS and Backend technologies. My work includes mobile apps, backend servers and occasionally working on web frontends to deliver performant solutions. I have worked on every stage from Idea to delivery. I am looking forward to move to backend technologies as a power-up on Android Experience. I have lead teams to deliver a solution that has helped local businesses and used to serve thousands of users.
